  Target the top-level block that contains the selection.
  Tiptap/ProseMirror doesn't strictly have a "focused block" class by default on the node itself 
  unless we use an extension or CSS check. 
  
  However, we can use the `ProseMirror-selectednode` for node selections.
  For text cursor, we usually need an extension to add a class to the active node.
  
  BUT: We can try a simple left-border on the editor container? No, that's the whole editor.
  
  Better approach: Use the `focus` extension or `uniqueId` to track active block?
  Novel/Tiptap starter kits often lack this specific "Notion" feature out of the box without an extension.
  
  Let's use a simple CSS trick for now if possible, or assume we might need a small extension later. 
  Actually, the `Draggable` extension often adds a class to the hovered block.
  
  For FOCUS, we need to target the block. 
  
  Let's add this to `drag-handle.css` for now as it relates to block-level UI.
  We will assume we might need to add a plugin to toggle a class on the active node.
  
  WAIT: Let's defer complexity. Deep styling often requires a plugin.
  Let's do SAVE STATUS and SKELETON first as they are React components.
  
  Actually, I can add a simple plugin in `extensions.ts` to add a class to the active node?
  Or use the `Focus` extension from Tiptap: `@tiptap/extension-focus`.
  
  Let's check if `@tiptap/extension-focus` is installed.
