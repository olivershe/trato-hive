# Trato Hive: AI-Native M&A CRM
## Product & Design Specification (v1.0)

### 1. Introduction & Core Principles

This document provides the foundational developer specification for Trato Hive, a unified, AI-Native M&A CRM. It is built to address a core gap in the market: the lack of a single platform that merges **verifiable, deep knowledge generation** with **end-to-end deal and relationship orchestration**.

Our architecture is not an "AI-Augmented" CRM (a database with AI features layered on top). Trato Hive is a true **System of Reasoning** built on three core principles:

1.  **Verifiability First:** All AI-generated output is secondary to the audit trail. Every number, claim, or summary must be hyperlinked directly to its source document, mitigating hallucination risk and meeting fiduciary requirements (a "citation-first" principle).
2.  **Unified & Composable:** The platform unifies Sourcing, Pipeline Management, and Diligence into one workflow. It is also built API-first to integrate with a firm's existing stack.
3.  **Agentic Orchestration:** AI agents do not just *assist*—they *execute* and *orchestrate* complex, multi-step workflows, such as diligence Q&A or target screening, freeing professionals for high-value judgment.

### 5. High-Level Data & UI Flow (Summary)

This diagram describes the end-to-end journey of data and user interaction.

1.  **Ingestion (Data Plane):** A user's email, a calendar invite, or a VDR document (PDF, XLSX) is ingested and associated with a specific deal.
2.  **Curation (Semantic Layer):** The document is processed, indexed, and all facts are added to the **Verifiable Fact Layer**. The **Knowledge Graph** links the document to its deal, company, and financials.
3.  **Orchestration (Agentic Layer):** An AI Agent (e.g., `Pipeline OS Agent`) detects the new data. It sees the new VDR document contains an updated EBITDA.
4.  **Action (Agentic Layer):** The Agent creates a new AI Task: "Review updated EBITDA for Project Sky."
5.  **Experience (Experience Layer):** The user sees this task in their **Command Center**. They click the **Deal 360°** and see the new EBITDA in the **"Verifiable Fact Sheet"** widget, highlighted in `Teal Blue` (as "new").
6.  **Generation (Experience Layer):** The user clicks the **"Generator"** tab and generates a new IC Deck. The deck *automatically* includes this new, verified EBITDA, complete with a `Gold` citation link back to the new VDR document.
