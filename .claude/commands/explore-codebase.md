### Pre-Implementation Codebase Exploration

As per @PROJECT_STATUS.md, we will now implement **Phase $ARGUMENTS**.

Please explore the relevant codebase and files so we can execute the specified tasks effectively without any overlaps with existing implementations.

**Exploration Objectives:**

1. **Schema/Database Layer** - Review Prisma schema for relevant models, relations, and enum patterns

2. **Backend (tRPC/Services)** - Identify related routers, service patterns, and shared utilities

3. **Frontend (Components/Extensions)** - Survey existing components, UI patterns, and Tiptap extensions

4. **Templates & Routing** - Review page templates, auto-creation patterns, and route structure

5. **Recent Phase Files** - Check files modified in previous phases (listed in PROJECT_STATUS.md)

**Deliverables:**
- Files to **create** vs. **modify**
- Task dependency mapping
- Reusable patterns to leverage
- Potential conflicts to avoid

Do not implement yet - just build context and report findings.
