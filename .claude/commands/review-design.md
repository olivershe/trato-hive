# Design Review (DEPRECATED)

> **DEPRECATED:** Use `/review-ui-chrome` instead for interactive Chrome-based UI reviews.

This command has been replaced by `/review-ui-chrome` which provides:
- Real-time browser automation via Claude Chrome extension
- Interactive screenshot capture
- Accessibility tree inspection
- Console error checking
- Responsive breakpoint testing

Run `/review-ui-chrome [url]` for comprehensive UI/UX validation.
