# Plan Task

<mode:plan>
Goal: Prepare a test-first, file-by-file engineering plan for the requested task.

Reading order:
1. Root CLAUDE.md
2. Relevant local CLAUDE.md (app/package/feature)
3. Relevant PRDs from /docs/prds/
4. Code in scope

Output:
1. Current state summary
2. Detailed test-first plan (Red → Green → Refactor) with explicit file paths
3. Risks, decisions, assumptions
4. Artifacts to update (plan.md, PRDs, migrations, logs)

No code implementation yet. Plan only.
